The LHCb detector is a flavour physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that aims to reconstruct particles 
consisting of $c$ and $b$ quarks. It is dedicated to precision measurements of CP violation and rare decays of the aforementioned $b$ 
hadrons.  
\section{Structure of the LHCb Detector}
The LHCb is a single-arm spectrometer with a forward angular coverage from approximately 300 (250) mrad in the bending (non-bending) plane. The detector is designed

\subsection{Magnet}
A dipole magnet is used to measure the momentum of charged particles by exploiting the curvature of their trajectories in the presence of a magnetic field. The measurement covers the forward acceptance of $\pm$ 250 mrad vertically and of $\pm$300 mrad horizontally. The magnet possesses an integrated magnetic field of 4 Tm for tracks of 10 m length, and is designed to accomodate the varying requirements of the magnetic field, ranging from 2 mT within the RICH envelope, and a maximum value in the regions between the Vertex Locator and the Trigger Tracker tracking station.\\

The magnet possesses saddle-shaped coils in a window frame yoke with sloping poles in order to match the required detector acceptance
