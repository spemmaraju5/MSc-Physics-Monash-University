    abstract = { Four decades after its prediction, the axion remains the most compelling solution to the strong-CP problem and a well-motivated dark matter candidate, inspiring a host of elegant and ultrasensitive experiments based on axion–photon mixing. This article reviews the experimental situation on several fronts. The microwave cavity experiment is making excellent progress in the search for dark matter axions in the μeV range and may plausibly be extended up to 100 μeV. Within the past several years, however, researchers have realized that axions are pervasive throughout string theories, but with masses that fall naturally in the neV range, for which an NMR-based search is under development. Both searches for axions emitted from the Sun's burning core and purely laboratory experiments based on photon regeneration have recently made great progress, with ambitious projects proposed for the coming decade. Each of these campaigns has pushed the state of the art in technology, enabling large gains in sensitivity and mass reach. Furthermore, each modality has been exploited in order to search for more generalized axion-like particles, which we also discuss in this review. We are hopeful, even optimistic, that the next review of the subject will concern the discovery of the axion, its properties, and its exploitation as a probe of early universe cosmology and structure formation. }

abstract = {The Vertex Locator (VELO) is a silicon tracking detector in the spectrometer of the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment. LHCb explores and investigates CP violation phenomena in b- and c- hadron decays and is one of the experiments operating on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. After run 1 and run 2 of LHC data taking (2011–2018), the LHCb detectors are being modernized within the LHCb upgrade I program. The upgrade aims to adjust the spectrometer to readout at full LHC 40 MHz frequency, which requires radical changes to the technologies currently used in LHCb. The hardware trigger is removed, and some of the detectors replaced. The VELO changes its tracking technology and silicon strips are replaced by 55 μm pitch silicon pixels. The readout chip for the VELO upgrade is the VeloPix ASIC. The number of readout channels increases to over 40 million, and the hottest ASIC is expected to produce the output data rate of 15 Gbit/s. New conditions challenge the software and the hardware side of the readout system and put special attention on the detector monitoring. This paper presents the upgraded VELO design and outlines the software aspects of the detector calibration in the upgrade I. An overview of the challenges foreseen for the upgrade II is given.}

abstract = {The LHCb simulation application, Gauss, consists of two independent phases, the generation of the primary event and the tracking of particles produced in the experimental setup. For the LHCb experimental program it is particularly important to model B meson decays: the EvtGen code developed in CLEO and BABAR has been chosen and customized for non-coherent B production as occuring in pp collisions at the LHC. The initial proton-proton collision is provided by a different generator engine, currently PYTHIA 6 for massive production of signal and generic pp collisions events. Beam gas events, background events originating from proton halo, cosmics and calibration events for different detectors can be generated in addition to pp collisions. Different generator packages as available in the physics community or specifically developed in LHCb are used for the different purposes. Running conditions affecting the generated events such as the size of the luminous region, the number of collisions occuring in a bunch crossing and the number of spill-over events from neighbouring bunches are modeled via dedicated algorithms appropriately configured. The design of the generator phase of Gauss will be described: a modular structure with well defined interfaces specific to the various tasks, e.g. pp collisions, particle decays, selections, etc. has been chosen. Different implementations are available for the various tasks allowing selecting and combining them as most appropriate at run time as in the case of PYTHIA 6 for pp collisions or HIJING for beam gas. The advantages of such structure, allowing for example to adopt transparently new generators packages, will be discussed.}

abstract = {In high-energy physics, Monte Carlo event generators (MCEGs) are used to simulate the interactions of high energy particles. MCEG event records store the information on the simulated particles and their relationships, and thus reflect the simulated evolution of physics phenomena in each collision event. We present the HepMC3 library, a next-generation framework for MCEG event record encoding and manipulation, which builds on the functionality of its widely-used predecessors to enable more sophisticated algorithms for event-record analysis. As compared to previous versions, the event record structure has been simplified, while adding the possibility to encode arbitrary information. The I/O functionality has been extended to support common input and output formats of various HEP MCEGs, including formats used in Fortran MCEGs, the formats established by the HepMC2 library, and binary formats such as ROOT; custom input or output handlers may also be used. HepMC3 is already supported by popular modern MCEGs and can replace the older HepMC versions in many others.

The EvtGen package provides a framework for the implementation of physics processes relevant to decays of B mesons and other resonances. Models of time dependent CP asymmetries in neutral B meson decays, semileptonic form-factor models, and a full decay table for B decays are a few of the implemented features.}

It contains a library of hard processes, models for initial- and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and several interfaces to external programs. Pythia 8.2 is the second main release after the complete rewrite from Fortran to C++, and now has reached such a maturity that it offers a complete replacement for most applications, notably for LHC physics studies. The many new features should allow an improved description of data.

Computer: Commodity PCs, Macs. Operating system: Linux, OS X; should also work on other systems. RAM: ∼10 megabytes Classification: 11.2. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models. Summary of revisions: Hundreds of new features and bug fixes, allowing improved modelling. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied.}

The software architecture, called GAUDI, supports event data processing applications that run in different processing environments, from the high level triggers in the on-line system to the final physics analysis. We present our major architectural design choices and outline the arguments that led to these choices. Several iterations of a software framework based on this architecture have been released and the framework is now being used by the physicists of the collaboration to facilitate the development of data processing algorithms.
