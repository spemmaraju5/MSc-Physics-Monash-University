\section{The Strong CP Problem}The two discrete symmetries that are essential to the motivation of the Strong CP problem are charge conjugation, $C$, and parity (i.e. an inversion of spatial coordinates), $P$. While each
of these symmetries can be individually violated by various physical phenomena, their combination CP is known to be conserved in both the strong and electromagnetic interactions, whilst being violated by weak interactions. The strong CP problem arises from the theory pertaining to QCD, which
permits such a violation. Despite this, however, such a process has not been experimentally observed. One can examine the QCD Lagrangian in Equation \ref{QCD_Lagrangian} below, which has been written to include the CP violating terms
\begin{equation}\label{QCD_Lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L}_{QCD} = -\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}-\frac{g_{s}^{2}\theta}{32\pi^{2}}G_{\mu\nu}\tilde{G}^{\mu\nu}+\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}-me^{i\theta'\gamma_{5}})\psi
\end{equation}
