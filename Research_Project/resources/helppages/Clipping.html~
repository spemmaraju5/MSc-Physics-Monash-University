<h3>Clipping</h3>
<br>

Independent of whether the grid is on or off, \feyngame\ will do
additional kinds of clipping when objects are moved by mouse or curved
by mouse wheel:<br>
<i>Vertex clipping.</i> If the end of a line is moved closer to another
  line (or to its other end) than a certain minimal distance, it will be
  connected with that line through a vertex.<br>
<i>Curvature clipping.</i> If the curvature of a line is decreased below
  a certain minimal value via the mouse wheel, it will be set to zero.
<i>Angle clipping.</i> If the slope of a straight line is close to a
  multiple of &pi;/2, it will be replaced by that multiple of
  $\pi/2$. Via the menu item \menu[,]{Edit, Clipping angles} or by
  repeatedly pressing \keystroke{c}, that value can be changed to
  $\pi/4$ or $\pi/16$, or zero.
\end{description}
This kind of clipping is introduced for the user's convenience, because
otherwise it would be rather clumsy to connect lines, or to turn a
curved line into a completely straight line. In order to overrule such
clipping, one can use \editframe\ to do a pixel-wise modification of the
position or the curvature.
