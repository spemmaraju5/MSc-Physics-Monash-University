<h3>The "+" Tile</h3>
<br>
<p text align = justify>
The left-most tile below the canvas in the main window is the so-called "+"-tile. It allows one to add all objects except for shapes to the list of tiles. They can then be accessed like any other object. They can even be included into the model file for future use using <b>File > Save model file (as)</b>.</p>
<br>
<p text align = justify>
An object tile can be removed from the list by pressing the <i>Shift</i>-key and selecting the tile (clicking on it).</p>
