<h3>Modelfile</h3>

It is part of the philosophy of <i>FeynGame</i> to use a pre-defined
 model (say, QED, the Standard Model, the MSSM, or a subset of the
 associated particles) where each particle corresponds to a line with a
 certain appearance.  This makes it particularly efficient to draw a
 particular diagram, because the different line styles for the individual
 particles have been defined beforehand, using the <i>model
 file</i>. A <i>model file</i> for describing the electro-weak interaction of the first two lepton generations would read
<br><br>
[ e, E, fermion, color=Red, label=e ]<br>
[ nue, Nue, fermion, color=dc27e7, label=&nu;<sub>e</sub> ]<br>
[ mu, Mu, fermion, color=Green, label=&mu;]<br>
[ numu, Numu, fermion, color=27e7b3,label=&nu;<sub>&mu;</sub> ]<br>
[ W, W, photon, color=dc27e7, label=W]<br>
[ Z, Z, photon, color=Blue, label=Z]<br>
[ ph, ph, photon, color=Green, label=&gamma; ]<br>
<br>
Each pair of square brackets
 defines a particle. The first two entries assign an internal name for
 the particle. If those are different from each other, it is assumed
 that the particle is charged and an arrow is added to the line if not stated
 otherwise. The third entry defines the basic line style. These three
 entries are required when defining a line in the <i>model file</i>. The
 <a href="Labels"><b>label</b></a> parameter is optional.</p>

Starting <i>FeynGame</i> by giving it the name of the <i>model file</i>
 as argument (including its path) will load the specific model instead of
 the default one. It is possible to open additional <i>model files</i> by
 either pressing the &#10010 right next to the tabs representing the
 currently opened <i>model files</i> or via <b>File > Load model file</b>.
 This lets one select a new <i>model file</i> to open. Upon confirmation,
 the new model file is added to the list of <i>model files</i> and can be
 activated by pressing the corresponding tab. One can press the &#10006 on
 a tab to close the corrsponding <i>model file</i> and remove it form the
 list of <i>model files</i>.</p>

A convenient option to modify the <i>model file</i> is to modify the
 appearance of an existing line within <i>FeynGame</i> (for example by using
 <a href="EditFrame"><b>EditFrame</b></a>), and then selecting
 the <a href="PlusTile"><b>"+" tile</b></a> in the main window.</p>

To create a completely new model file, one can do so manually by creating
 a ".model" file and editing it in a text editor. Another way is to draw a
 diagram onto the canvas and then pressing <b>File > Convert canvas to model</b>.
 This will create a new model that contains all the objects that are drawn
 on the canvas. It also derives the Feynman rules from the vertices that are
 present on the canvas. It should be noted that lines and vertices are considered
 to be of the same <i>type</i> even if they have different descriptions.</p>

One can also create a new model by merging several of the opened models by
 pressing <b>File > Merge models </b>. This opens another window where one can
 select the models that should be merged. Upon confirmation the new merged model
 will appear as one of the model tabs. The models that were merged remain unchanged</p>
