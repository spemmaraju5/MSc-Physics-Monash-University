<h3>Export as Image</h3>
<br>

<p text align="justify">
A diagram can be exported to an image file in various formats using <b>File > Export as image</b> from the menu. None of the <a href="Auxiliary">auxiliary features</a> will be exported, only the plain diagram will be visible.
</p>
<br>
<p text align="justify">
The boundaries of the exported diagram are determined automatically by the area on the canvas where objects are drawn.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Export as Postscript/Encapsulated Postscript</h3>
<br>
<p text align="justify">
One can also export a diagram directly to a Postscript or Encapsulated Postscript file by using <b>File > Export to PS/EPS</b>. A new window with several options will open:
&bull; <i>Restrict printing area to displayed rectangle:</i> The bounding box of the PDF is determined automatically from the actual location of the diagram on the canvas. The area that will be printed is indicated by a rectangle.<br><br>
&bull; <i>Print full canvas:</i> The bounding box is determined by the size of the canvas.<br><br>
&bull; <i>Print on maximum size:</i> The diagram is put on a canvas with a fixed size and then printed. This ensures that all diagrams get scaled the same way when exporting even when the size of the window was changed.<br><br>

&bull; <i>Display viewbox/trim parameters</i> The bounding box parameters are displayed when the diagram is printed or exported. They can then be copied to the clipboard and pasted into a text editor, for example as parameters for the <i>\includegraphics</i> command in <i>LaTeX</i>:<br>
  <i>\includegraphics[viewport = 18 347 577 824,
    size=.3\textwidth]{ggh.eps}</i><br>
  Equivalently, one can use the <i>trim</i> parameters.<br><br>

&bull; <i>Print in B/W:</i> Print in black-and-white. More precisely: Lines and the borders of vertices are drawn in black.  The interior of the vertices is drawn black or white depending on the brightness of its actual color. All other objects remain untouched.<br><br>

&bull; <i>Dimensions of the output:</i> The diagram is scaled in such a way that it fits into the selected page format. For Postscript export this format is also the format of the output file. For Encapsulated Postscript export the file gets trimmed at the required edges. It should not be necessary to change this option.<br><br>
&bull; <i>Export in landscape:</i> This option puts the selected page format from the previous option into landscape. It should also not be necessary to change this option.<br><br>
&bull; <i>Export to:</i> Choose an output file. The file type is taken from the file extension. Possible extensions are ".ps" (Postscript) and ".eps" (Encapsulated Postscript).
